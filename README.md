## Analyze A/B Test Results

For this project, I will be working to analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," 
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through 
to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page,
or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Project Specifications
### Code quality
 - All code cells can be run without error.
 - Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
 
### Statistical Analysis
 - All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted
 - For all numeric values, the correct results of the analysis are provided
 - Conclusions inlcude not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.
